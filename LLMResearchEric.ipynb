It is essential for creating sentences that refer to actions completed in the past.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **First Group Verbs**: These are verbs ending in -er (such as 'parler'). To form the past participle, you drop the -er and add -√©. For example: \n",
      "   - parler ‚Üí parl√© (to speak ‚Üí spoken).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Second Group Verbs**: These are verbs ending in -ir (such as 'finir'). To form the past participle, you drop the -ir and add -i. For example:\n",
      "   - finir ‚Üí fini (to finish ‚Üí finished).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Third Group Verbs**: This is a more irregular category, including verbs like 'prendre' and 'voir'. Their past participles must be memorized. For instance:\n",
      "   - prendre ‚Üí pris (to take ‚Üí taken),\n",
      "   - voir ‚Üí vu (to see ‚Üí seen).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, remember that the past participle agrees in gender and number with the subject when used with the auxiliary verb '√™tre' and in some cases with 'avoir' if there's a preceding direct object.\n",
